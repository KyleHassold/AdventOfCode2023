# Advent Of Code 2023
By Kyle Hassold

## Goal
This year is my first attempt to solve all Advent of Code challenges as the come out. I will be aiming to earn some points by submitting the puzzle solutions within the 100 submission before cleaning my code. For my initial solutions, I will be writing my algorithms in Python as it is perfect for rapid development and is the language I am most experienced in.

For challenges that are more computationally heavy, I will be attempting to optimize my inital algorithms in python before switch to the new language called Mojo. I will then utilize the strong typing, vectorization, parallelization, and more that is possible in Mojo to develop code that runs with significant speed-ups.

## Final Notes

This project is mostly for fun, but also works as great practice problems for me to learn Mojo and remember some long forgotten lessons from my algorithm classes in college. Please feel free to add issues to this repo if you stumble across my work and believe there is some way to improve my code. Thanks and happy holidays!
